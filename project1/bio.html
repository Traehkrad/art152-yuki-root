          <h4>Birth</h4>
            <p>She was born as Katherine Jane Braden in Decatur, Illinois on October 12, 1945.</p>
          <h4>Education</h4>
            <p>She initially studied interior design for architecture at Michigan State University,
              but switched to industrial design and graduated in 1967. A visit
              to the Museum of Modern Art during a family trip to the New York
              Fair in 1964 provoked her interest in the power of design.</p>
          <h4>Careers</h4>
            <p>After graduation, she joined Unimark International, a design firm
             led by key figures in American Modernist graphic design such as Massimo Vignelli,
             Ralph Eckerstrom of Container Corporation, Jay Doblin, and Herbert Bayer.
             It was here at the Unimark offices where she was exposed to the strict
             Swiss typographic and design approaches which came to permeate much
             of America corporate communications through the late 1960s and 1970s.</p>
             <p>Following Unimark, she worked for a year in the corporate identity
              offices of the Chrysler Corporation, then joined the Boston design
              firm Omnigraphics, where she worked on several projects for the MIT
              Press with Muriel Cooper. Next, she joined the Detroit advertising
              design studio, Designers and Partners, where she met Edward Fella,
              designer - illustrator - cartoonist. Although ad agency work was
              not very compatible with design thinking and ethics, the opportunities
              she was given and the connections she made were an important part
              of her design experience. She also worked with Xerox Education Group and other major advertising agencies.</p>
              <p>In 1971, she founded the practice McCoy & McCoy, Inc. with her husband,
                Michael McCoy.</p>
            <h4>Educator Period</h4>
              <p>In Fall 1971, she began her career in design education when she
                was appointed co-chair of the Cranbrook Academy of Art graduate
                design program with her husband, Michael McCoy.
                While she led the graphic design program, her husband led the
                industrial design program, both 2D and 3D design students shared
                studios and explored interdisciplinary approaches to designing.
                Katherine describes combining the "objective" typographic approach
                that she knew through reading and the Unimark experience with an
                interest in the social and cultural activism that was in the air
                in the late '60s when creating and reinventing the program.</p>
              <p>Reinvented by the McCoys, the program was organized around
                experimentation in the studio, with minimal structure or assignments
                – a return to the Art Academy's original method. There were no
                deadlines, papers, or finals, other than the expectation of new
                work in weekly critiques and semester-end self-evaluations and
                extended bibliographies. A final degree project and thesis were
                required in the last semester. The McCoys required students to
                read deeply about the history and theory behind the design concerns
                on which they were focusing. Each student was encouraged to develop
                their own design voice and vision, through a mix of studio experiments
                and client projects, sometimes on grant-funded projects with the
                McCoys. Students sometimes had the opportunity to work directly
                with Katherine McCoy, and this became the counterbalance for the
                experimental studio work. In the 1970s, Katherine McCoy took two
                major leaps to advance the program, in terms of student work.
                First, she began to change the introductory typography projects
                to allow students a new semiotic interpretation. This allowed
                students to begin to drive to the solutions and to depart from
                the strict Modernist vocabulary used in the program in previous
                years. Included are stylistic elements that had previously been
                underused by Modernist typographers, such as historical or
                vernacular type forms or images. The second leap was to allow
                the more advanced and able students to take lead on the exploration of theory.</p>
              <p>In 1991, Katherine and Michael McCoy, along with a team 2-D
                students, produced the book "Cranbrook Design: The New Discourse"
                (Rizzoli International Publications). The book documented the
                work that produced in the Cranbrook studios during the 1980s, and
                it "probably sealed the reputation of the school" as a place where
                the visual qualities of the work, sometimes generated by a highly
                creative interpretation of theory, took precedence without regard
                to the "needs of the profession".</p>
              <p>After 24 years of creative work, the McCoys left their positions
                in 1995. They moved to Chicago where they spent each fall semester
                at the Illinois Institute of Technology's Institute of Design,
                giving senior lectures and seminars until 2004. Her most well-known
                position with the Illinois Institute of Technology's Institute
                of Design, from 1995–2003, and the Royal College of Art in London.
                There Katherine focused on theoretical and methodological issues,
                particularly on audience-centered communications, and the teaching
                and practice of graphic design within the context of new media.</p>
            <h4>Current Life</h4>
              <p>McCoy now consults in communications design, design curriculum
                planning at Kansas City Art Institute and post-professional design
                education as a partner of McCoy & McCoy, and High Ground Tools
                and Strategies for Design. High Ground Design is a series of
                workshops created by Katherine and her husband, Michael McCoy for
                other professional designers to work in their studio. High Ground
                is dedicated to expanding design skills and methods, as well as
                opening up to the vision of design, questioning assumptions and
                redefining the nature of design.</p>
