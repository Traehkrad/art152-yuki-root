      <h1>Autumn Wednesday</h1>
      <h4>By James Turner</h4>
      <p>I’m older than I’ve ever been before.<br>
      As each day dawns I’m older by a day.<br>
      The grub that gobbled Tuesday’s wanting more.<br>
      Its name is time, and time is here to stay.</p>

      <p>Its chomping started back when I did. Then,<br>
      it scared the child I was and made him ill,<br>
      though once or twice before the age of ten<br>
      it stopped, a glimpse of calm that haunts me still.</p>

      <p>Time’s not a problem these days anyhow,<br>
      Its speed cannot be slowed, and I don’t try,<br>
      for now will always go on being now<br>
      though day may follow day until I die.<br>
      That falling leaf. Those unseen running feet.<br>
      The soft light on that roof across the street.</p>
