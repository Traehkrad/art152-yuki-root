          <h4>Reasons for This Website's Creation</h4>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my website containing information on first-aid
            procedures. The reason behind the creation of this website is to better
            inform you and others to help be the hero that'll be needed in the case
            that disaster strikes.</p>
            <p>You don't need to have any superpowers like the heroes in the movies.
            Though having the knowledge of human anatomy and physiology will help out
            in your endeavors to help others. Dr. Strange would know what I'm talking about, right?</p>
            <img src="img/drstrange_beyonce.gif" alt="Dr. Strange saying 'Try me, Beyonce.'">
            <figcaption>Thanks for the voice of confidence, Doc.</figcaption>
            <p>Regardless, through the techniques provided on this website, you will get to know some parts of
            the human body. Also, do take into account that an adult's body has organs in different locations
            in comparison to those of children's and that everyone's body should be treated as their own separate cases.
            You never know if someone could be born with some kind of genetic mutation like osteogenesis imperfecta which would
            be a rather... unpleasant situation if said person went into cardiac arrest and required CPR.</p>
