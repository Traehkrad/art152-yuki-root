          <h3>CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)</h3>
          <img src="img/cpr_logo.png" alt="Abstract stickfigures performing CPR.">
          <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p class="byline">An emergency procedure that combines chest compressions
            with artificial ventilation in an attempt to preserve intact brain functions
            until further measures are taken to restore blood circulation and breathing in
            someone who is in cardiac arrest.</p>
            <p class="byline">There are many variations to CPR and the first variation will be hands only.</p>

            <img src="img/CPR_Check.jpg" alt="Person checking for pulse or breathing.">
            <h4 class="red">Step 1:</h4> <h4>Check for (Un)Responsiveness</h4>
              <p class="byline">Usually if a person collapses but remains conscious, CPR will typically not be
              required. In case they do fall unconscious and unresponsive, you should perform some form of CPR
              even if untrained or rusty in your abilities.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Shake victim's shoulders and loudly ask if they are okay. If given no response, check for pulse
                and or breathing while someone calls emergency services.</li>
                <li>This version of CPR focuses only on chest compressions and is ideal for those without formal CPR
                training, or for those uncertain of their abilities.</li>
              </ul>

            <img src="img/CPR_911.jpg" alt="Person calling for 911.">
            <h4 class="red">Step 2:</h4> <h4>Call Emergency Services</h4>
              <p class="byline">If after step one and person is still unconscious, call emergency services before anything else.
              On occasion, CPR can revive people, but should be viewed as buying time until emergency personnel arrive with
              appropriate equipment.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>If two or more people are at the scene, one dials for help while the other performs CPR.</li>
                <li>If a person is unresponsive because of suffocation (from drowning, for example), then it's
                recommended to immediately begin CPR for one minute and then call your local emergency number.</li>
                <li>If the victim is a child between the ages of one to eight years, perform five cycles of chest
                compressions and rescue breathing before calling Emergency Services if you are the only person available. This should take roughly two minutes.</li>
                <li>When you call emergency services, the dispatcher could instruct you on how to perform CPR.</li>
              </ul>

            <img src="img/CPR_Laidback.jpg" alt="Victim laid on their back against the floor.">
            <h4 class="red">Step 3:</h4> <h4>Lay Victim on Their Back</h4>
              <p class="byline">In order to perform hand-only CPR, victim needs to be laid flat with their back touching the ground, preferably on a firm surface,
              with head facing up. If the person is laying on his stomach or sides, gently roll them onto their back while supporting their head and neck.
              Make note if the person experienced trauma while falling and becomming unconscious.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Once on his back, kneel next to the person's neck and shoulders so you have better access to his chest and mouth.</li>
                <li>Keep in mind that you should not move the person if you suspect he may have suffered a significant head, neck, or
                spinal injury. In this case, moving him is life-threatening and should be avoided, unless emergency help won't be available
                for a long time (a few hours or more).</li>
              </ul>

            <img src="img/CPR_Compression.jpg" alt="CPR compression directed to the center of the chest.">
            <h4 class="red">Step 4:</h4> <h4>Rapid Compression Down Center of Chest</h4>
              <p class="byline">Place on hand directly over person's chest, between their nipples, and your other hand ontop of the first
              for reinforcement. Press down on victim's chest firmly and rapidly - aim for 100 chest compressions per minute until paramedics arrive.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Use your upper body weight and strength, not just your arm strength, and push straight down on the chest.</li>
                <li>Your chest compressions should cause the person's chest to depress at least 2 inches (5 cm). Push hard and
                understand that it is likely you will break the person's ribs. This is extremely common, and you shouldn't stop
                compressions even if you think this has happened.</li>
                <li>Chest compressions are difficult and it is fine to let others take over when you are tired.</li>
                <li>Continue until person becomes responsive or until the medical team arrives to take over.</li>
              </ul>
